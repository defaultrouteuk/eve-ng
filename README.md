Are you frustrated trying to connect to your local/remote EVE-NG lab? 
Does it annoy you when your terminal emulator of choise doesn't do tabs properly? Or maybe you can't be bothered click each on in turn?

I've tested it with Windows 10 (w/ SecureCRT), MacOS Catalina (w/ ZOC) and IRIX 6.5 (w/ Winterm). 

Requirements: Windows support requires WSL for bash/linux support (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
