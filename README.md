Are you frustrated trying to connect to your local/remote EVE-NG lab? 
Does it annoy you when your terminal emulator of choice doesn't do tabs properly? Or maybe you can't be bothered to click each on in turn? 
Me too! This script may be for you!
<br /><br />
I've gone old-skool (as I like) and written a simple bash script that takes all the pain away. The script has been tested with Windows 10 (running Linux subsystem) and SecureCRT, MacOS Catalina w/ ZOC) and IRIX 6.5 w/ Winterm. It may need some editing to set the binaries and it's not totally intuitive when it comes to the pulling of the running devices, but I'm editing the script as I study to make it more robust.

Clients tested: Secure CRT 7, ZOC 7, native *nix terminals
<br />
Windows Requirement: Windows support requires WSL for bash/linux support (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
